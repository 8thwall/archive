## Publishing your 8th Wall project to gaming platforms

Since 8th Wall HTML5 bundles are fully contained builds, they can be self hosted or published to many gaming platforms.

### Self-Host

:::note
The HTML5 bundle can be self hosted or deployed in many different ways. The instructions below is just one example using `npm`.
For more comprehensive information on self hosting, check out this [guide](https://github.com/mikeroyal/Self-Hosting-Guide).
:::

1. Download the `.zip` bundle, then unzip the file.

3. Run `npm install --global http-server` to install the [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) npm package as a global CLI tool.
4. Run `http-server <path_to_unzipped_folder>`
    1. Example: `http-server /Users/John/Downloads/my-project`
5. There should be some logs that list a series of local URLs like:
```sh

2. Create a new application by clicking the Button in the top right corner
    1. Enter a name for the application and accept the terms of service

    1. `git clone https://github.com/8thwall/discord-activity-example`
    2. Run `npm install`
    3. Unzip the `.zip` downloaded earlier containing the frontend of the project.
    4. Create a `.env` file in the root of the repo, and fill it out with the details from the Discord Developer Portal:
    ```

    DISCORD_CLIENT_SECRET=XXXXXXXXXX
    DISCORD_CLIENT_HOST_PATH=/path/to/unzipped/folder
    ```
    5. Enter `npm start` to start the server.

2. Use `cloudflared` to create a tunnel, so the project will be publicly accessible over the internet.
    1. `brew install cloudflared` to download the `cloudflared` CLI tool
    2. Run `cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:8888`.
    3. Make note of the URL that was generated.

    Example:
    ```
