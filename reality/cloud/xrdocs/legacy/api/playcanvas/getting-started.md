## Add your App Key {#add-your-app-key}

Go to Settings -> External Scripts

The following two scripts should be added:

* `https://cdn.8thwall.com/web/xrextras/xrextras.js`

1. Go to Settings -> Rendering.
2. Make sure that "Prefer WebGL 2.0" is **unchecked**.

## Add xrcontroller.js {#add-xrcontroller}
The 8th Wall sample PlayCanvas projects are populated with an XRController game object. If you are starting with a blank project, download `xrcontroller.js` from <https://www.github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/gettingstarted/playcanvas/scripts/> and attach to an Entity in your scene.

**NOTE**: Only for SLAM and/or Image Target projects. `xrcontroller.js` and `facecontroller.js` or
`layerscontroller.js` cannot be used simultaneously.

Option | Description
--------- | -----------
disableWorldTracking | If true, turn off SLAM tracking for efficiency.
shadowmaterial | Material which you want to use as a transparent shadow receiver (e.g. for ground shadows). Typically this material will be used on a "ground" plane entity positioned at (0,0,0)

## Add layerscontroller.js {#add-layerscontroller}
The 8th Wall sample PlayCanvas projects are populated with a FaceController game object. If you are starting with a blank project, download `layerscontroller.js` from <https://www.github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/gettingstarted/playcanvas/scripts/> and attach to an Entity in your scene.

**NOTE**: Only for Sky Effects projects. `layerscontroller.js` and `facecontroller.js` or
`xrcontroller.js` cannot be used simultaneously.

## Add facecontroller.js {#add-facecontroller}
The 8th Wall sample PlayCanvas projects are populated with a FaceController game object. If you are starting with a blank project, download `facecontroller.js` from <https://www.github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/gettingstarted/playcanvas/scripts/> and attach it to an Entity in your scene.

**NOTE**: Only for Face Effects projects. `facecontroller.js` and `xrcontroller.js` or
`layerscontroller.js` or `handcontroller.js` cannot be used simultaneously.

Option | Description
--------- | -----------
headAnchor | The entity to anchor to the root of the head in world space.

## Add handcontroller.js {#add-handcontroller}
The 8th Wall sample PlayCanvas projects are populated with a HandController game object. If you are starting with a blank project, download `handcontroller.js` from <https://www.github.com/8thwall/web/tree/master/gettingstarted/playcanvas/scripts/> and attach it to an Entity in your scene.

**NOTE**: Only for Hand Tracking projects. `handcontroller.js` and `xrcontroller.js` or
`layerscontroller.js` or `facecontroller.js` cannot be used simultaneously.
