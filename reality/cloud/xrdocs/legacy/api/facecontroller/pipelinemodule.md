# XR8.FaceController.pipelineModule()

`XR8.FaceController.pipelineModule()`

## Description {#description}

Creates a camera pipeline module that, when installed, receives callbacks on when the camera has started, camera proessing events, and other state changes. These are used to calculate the camera's position.

## Parameters {#parameters}

None

## Returns {#returns}

Return value is an object made available to [`onUpdate`](/legacy/api/camerapipelinemodule/onupdate) as:

`processCpuResult.facecontroller: { rotation, position, intrinsics, cameraFeedTexture }`

Property  | Type | Description
--------- | ---- | -----------
rotation | `{w, x, y, z}` | The orientation (quaternion) of the camera in the scene.
position | `{x, y, z}` | The position of the camera in the scene.
intrinsics | `[Number]` | A 16 dimensional column-major 4x4 projection matrix that gives the scene camera the same field of view as the rendered camera feed.
cameraFeedTexture | [`WebGLTexture`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebGLTexture) | The texture containing camera feed data.
