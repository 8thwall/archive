# Invalid Timestamps Detected

#### Issue {#issue}

On iOS devices, console logs display a warning that states `webvr-polyfill: Invalid timestamps detected: Timestamp from devicemotion outside expected range.`

#### Resolution {#resolution}

No action required.

This is a **warning** coming from `webvr-polyfill`, a dependency of the AFrame/8Frame library. Devicemotion is an event coming from the browser that fires at a regular interval. It indicates the amount of physical force of acceleration the device is receiving at that time. These "Invalid timestamp" messages are a byproduct of iOS's devicemotion implementation where timestamps are sometimes reported out of order.

This is simply a **warning**, not an error, and can be safely ignored. It does not have any impact on your Web AR experience.
