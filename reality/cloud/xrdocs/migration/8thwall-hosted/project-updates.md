# Project Updates

## Image Targets

If your project utilizes image targets, you need to configure them at the start of your experience.

To enable image targets, call `XR8.XrController.configure` before any other code:

```
XR8.XrController.configure({
  imageTargetData: [
    require('../image-targets/target1.json'),
    require('../image-targets/target2.json'),
 ],
})
```

:::info
Autoloaded targets will have a `"loadAutomatically": true` property in the json file.

## Asset Bundles

References to asset bundles may need to be updated. Asset bundles are now plain folders.

For example, the physics playground sample project uses a gLTF asset bundle. When running the project for the first time, we encounter a compiler error:

![](/images/migration/asset-bundle-error.png)

To fix the issue, we need to update **all references** to reflect the correct location and name of the asset.

In this case, we need to update the gLTF path from:
```
/assets/models/props/cannonball.gltf
```
to:
```
/assets/models/props/cannonball.gltf/Prop_CannonBall.gltf
```

## Optimization

If you are not using the XR Engine, you can remove the xr.js script tag from index.html and delete the external/xr/ folder to save bandwidth.

If you are using the XR Engine, you can also customize whether `face`, `slam`, or both, are loaded on the `data-preload-chunks` attribute.
