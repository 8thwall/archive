# Self Hosted Projects

Existing self-hosted projects will work without any change until Feb 28, 2027. This guide walks through the process of migrating from the closed 8th Wall engine to the open source 8th Wall engine, which will mean you project can live on beyond Feb 2027.

:::info
The open-source 8th Wall engine does **not support** cloud-dependent features or those we don’t have license to distribute such as:
* VPS / Maps
* Hand Tracking
* Modules / Backends
:::

To migrate a self-hosted project to the open-source engine:

1. Download [xr-standalone.zip](https://8th.io/xrjs) and unzip it into your project folder
2. Remove the script tag for `apps.8thwall.com/xrweb` and replace it with `<script async src="./path/to/xr.js"></script>`
3. Add `data-preload-chunks` to the script tag or call `await XR8.loadChunk()` in your code before starting the engine. See sections below for more details.

:::note
`data-preload-chunks="face, slam"` is also supported for experiences using both world and face effects.
:::


## World Effects

If you're using world tracking, add `data-preload-chunks="slam"` to the script tag or call `await XR8.loadChunk('slam')` in your code before starting the engine.

## Face Effects

If you're using face tracking, add `data-preload-chunks="face"` to the script tag or call `await XR8.loadChunk('face')` in your code before starting the engine.

## Image Targets

If you're using image targets, add `data-preload-chunks="slam"` to the script tag or call `await XR8.loadChunk('slam')` in your code before starting the engine.

### Download Image Targets

Download the image targets from the 8th Wall console:

![](/images/migration/download-image-targets.png)

You will receive a .zip file containing your image targets. Move this folder into your self-hosted project.

### Configure Image Targets

Configure the image targets at the start of your experience.

To enable image targets, call `XR8.XrController.configure` before any other code:

```
XR8.XrController.configure({
  imageTargetData: [
    require('../image-targets/target1.json'),
    require('../image-targets/target2.json'),
 ],
})
```

:::info
Autoloaded targets will have a `"loadAutomatically": true` property in the json file.
